Just a pickle trying to find it's way back to it's jar

Main idea: 
2 story house style level
You're a pickle that's out of it's brine and drying out, you have to find the jar of pickle brine before the other 3 player pickles.
You have to avoid things like cat's, dog's and babies/kids; which will kill you
Pickle jar could be anywhere, actually less likely in the kitchen where you may think, could be under a table, in garage, toilet, etc
Finding liquid during your search could give you extra time

Cut scenes:
horror parodys of you witnessing other pickles become food: "Like diced and put on a burger"

Bad guy idea?:
Cucumbers (because we all know cucumbers are just wannabe pickles) with hair dryers?
.... MILITANT cucumbers with hair dryers
